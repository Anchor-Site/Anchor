# Anchor
Anchor is a static site generator for the modern web.

## What is Anchor?
Anchor is an embeddable static site generator that operates within the browser
itself. The purpose is to provide an easy-to-use editing experience that allows
users to create content for the web without paying huge expenses with traditional
hosting methods. It is targeted towards blogging platforms.

### Alternatives

For many users, the choice boils down to two options:
- WordPress (and similar) - Easy to set up and get started with
- Jekyll (and similar) - Flexible, secure, and much cheaper in the long run

In many cases, the second option is limited to more technical users, as most of the
tools required for static site generation are limited to command line tools. This
leaves the first option for many non-technical users, which due to hosting costs can
end up costing people quite a bit of money every year.

Anchor is intended to bridge the gap between these two methods, providing the ability
to edit a blog inside the browser like WordPress does, while still providing the
benefits of using a static site generator.
